  description: "As a front-end developer, I focus in building, debugging, and maintaining responsive and accessible web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js. \n\nWhat I like about front-end development is solving all kinds of problems, whether it is creating a smooth animated site, or fixing navigation, so users can find information quickly and easily. \n\nThat is why I believe in delivering a fast-loading, responsive website with basic search engine optimization, and a user-friendly experience with clean, well-documented code that works across all browsers. I also conduct audits and refactor existing sites to improve usability. I value clear communication and strive to deliver projects on time and within budget. \n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new design trends or experimenting with side projects that push my skills further. If you are looking for a front-end developer, let's start your project today."
